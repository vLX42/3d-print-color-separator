# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

# Feature Specification: Web App for PNG Color Separation and SVG Conversion

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-web`  
**Created**: 9 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a web app that takes a PNG file, finds 4 or 8 colors, separates each color into a transparent PNG, then converts each to a vector-based SVG, and finally downloads a joined SVG with no overlapping colors. Each step should allow downloading the files, and a process bar should show progress. The UI should be modern and visually appealing. Debug mode should allow downloading intermediate files.

there is a test file for all the tests /web/public/web/public/Gemini_Generated_Image_6zc1b66zc1b66zc1.png 
"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user uploads a PNG image to the web app, selects the number of colors (4 or 8), and initiates the color separation process. The app generates separate transparent PNGs for each color, then converts each PNG to an SVG. The user can download each intermediate file and, finally, a joined SVG with no overlapping colors. A process bar shows progress through each step. Debug mode allows downloading files at each stage for inspection.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a PNG file is uploaded, **When** the user selects 4 colors and starts the process, **Then** the app generates 4 transparent PNGs, converts each to SVG, and allows downloading all files and the final joined SVG.
2. **Given** a PNG file is uploaded, **When** the user selects 8 colors and starts the process, **Then** the app generates 8 transparent PNGs, converts each to SVG, and allows downloading all files and the final joined SVG.
3. **Given** debug mode is enabled, **When** the process runs, **Then** the user can download all intermediate files at each step.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the PNG has fewer than 4 or 8 distinct colors?
- How does the system handle very large PNG files?
- What if the PNG contains transparency or gradients?
- How are errors reported if file conversion fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload a PNG file.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select the number of colors (4 or 8) for separation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST analyze the PNG and separate each color into a transparent PNG file.
- **FR-004**: System MUST convert each separated PNG into a vector-based SVG file.
- **FR-005**: System MUST join the SVGs into a single SVG with no overlapping colors.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to download each intermediate PNG and SVG file.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a process bar indicating progress through each step.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a debug mode to allow downloading files at each stage.
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure the final SVG does not have overlapping colors.
- **FR-010**: System MUST present a modern, visually appealing UI.
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and inform the user.
- **FR-012**: System MUST support transparent backgrounds in output files.
- **FR-013**: System MUST support downloading the final joined SVG file.
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle PNGs with fewer than 4 or 8 colors. If there fewer colors than 4 and 8 just make empty files for the rest.
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle PNGs with transparency or gradients. It need to produce as smooth one color image as possible.
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle large PNG files efficiently. The PNG are medium sized.

### Key Entities
- **User Upload**: Represents the PNG file uploaded by the user; attributes: file name, file size, image data.
- **Color Layer**: Represents each separated color as a transparent PNG; attributes: color value, PNG data.
- **SVG Layer**: Represents the vectorized version of each color layer; attributes: color value, SVG data.
- **Process State**: Tracks progress through each step; attributes: current step, completion status.
- **Debug Mode**: Represents whether debug mode is enabled; attributes: enabled/disabled, downloadable files.
